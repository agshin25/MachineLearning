# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Projects from Scratch

This repository contains my implementations of various machine learning algorithms **from scratch** (without sklearn or other high-level libraries).  
Each project includes a preprocessing pipeline, the model implementation, training process, and evaluation on real datasets.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### 1. Logistic Regression from Scratch
- Implemented gradient descent with L2 regularization
- Built a Preprocessor class (missing value handling, one-hot encoding, standardization)
- Applied to German Credit dataset for financial risk modeling  
ðŸ‘‰ [Go to Project](./logistic_regression_from_scratch)
---

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pure math implementations (no sklearn for models)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal
To deeply understand the math & mechanics behind machine learning by implementing core algorithms step by step.
